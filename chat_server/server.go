  go b.handleBroadcast()

	http.Handle("/", fs)
	// HandleFunc will call when the user hit the endpoint, there will be a new HandleFunc in the getHandleConnections fn.
	// But there is only one broker. Which means only one Broadcast channel.

Questions?
line 22 what does Handle do? fs?
line 17 explain websocket.Upgrader{}
why need two threads?
